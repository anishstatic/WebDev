DOMIN-It is the address that people type toto a browser address bar to find the website. For example www google.com,youtube.com
DNS RESOLVER-The Domain name server(DNS) is the phonebook of the internet. Each device connected to the internet has its own ip address
so DNS resolver converts the hostname(www youtube.com) to the computer friendly ip address.
HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocal)-It is the set of rules for transfering the files,text,images,sound etc over the web which every web protal has to follow the rules.
How to check ip address using comand prompt- we have to click on the search bar on the laptop and then write command prompt and an application will open and write
"ipconfig" and press enter, it will show the ip address of our laptop.
PORTS-It is a software-defined number associated to a network protocal that receives or transmits communication for a specific service.
